these are the steps for creating and working with git
1- creating directory by: mkdir
2- entering that folder by: cd [folder name]
3- creating git repository by command: git init
4- checking if we already have set the config by command: git config --get user.name/user.email
5- setting or editing the config by command: git config --global user.name ""/ user.email ""
6- creating a file by command: touch
7- editing the file (here we used nano command for this text file)
8- using command: git status for checking the status of the file whether it is untracked or modified or in the staging area
9- as our file is untracked now, we use command: git add "file name" to move it to the staging area
10- then we use command: git commit "descripting message" to setting the file as commit
11- we can edit the file again and by using command: git status we can see that it is labeled as modified
12- we edit the file again to check the status of the file and the differences between commits.
13- we can check the edited details by command: git diff if we have the file in untracked, modified or staging area. this command check the differences of the file and the Head commit
14- we can use command: git diff HEAD^ to check the one commit before the Head and use git diff HEAD~4 to check the one which is 4 time before the Head we can put any number instead of 4
15- we can use command: git log to check all the commits with a comprehensive detail. we also can use git log --oneline to see just the comments of the commits in one line
16- we can use comman: git blame to see the details of the history of every edited part of the file and its author
17- we also can use command: git tag to set a human readable tag or description for a commit
18- if we want to see the datails of all the edits and actions in the repository, we can use command: git reflog
