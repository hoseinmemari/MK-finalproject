these are the steps for creating and working with git
1- creating directory by mkdir
2- entering that folder by cd
3- creating git repository by git init
4- checking if we already set the config by git config --get user.name/user.email
5- setting or editting the config by git config --global user.name ""/ user.email ""
6- creating a file by touch command
7- edditing the file (here we used nano command for this text file)
8- using git status for checking the status of the file whether it is untracked or modified or in the staging area
9- as it is untracked, we use command: git add "file name" to move it to the staging area
10- then we use command: git commit "descripting message" to setting the file as commit
11- we can edit the file again and by using command: git status we can see that it is labeled as modified
12- we edit the file again to check the status of the file and the differences between commits.
